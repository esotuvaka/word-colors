# Word Colors Web App

## Built with react and tailwindcss

This app can take any word, sentence, idea, or random string of letters, numbers, characters, etc. Because it uses ASCII characters it should work with most, if not all inputs of keyboard characters.

Currently doesn't recognize hex colors, so will process them, but I can add a check that will not process hexadecimal strings and will display the input color.
